### Thank you to all sponsors and supporter!

### Link to the official Home Assistant integration page
This project/repo was merged into the HASS core --> [Link to integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wiz/)

This repo will be archived. No future updates are committed here.

## :muscle: Change Log

It is done - the PR to HASS core was merged! [@bdraco](https://github.com/bdraco) does a tone of improvements and contributes some incredible fixes to the integration.
BUT all changes are made directly to the HASS PR. In the next release (2022.3) of HASS the WiZ integration will be natively integrated and can be used without HACS or custom_components. The auto-discovery and timeout handling was also improved massively. Sockets/Smart Plugs now detected correctly too.

**Please stay tuned and look for the next release 2022.3.** Don't use HACS or the custom_component anymore. You have only search in the integration list for "WiZ".

**This repository will not be updated and downstreamed from the HASS release for now.**

**Thank you to all testers, sponsors, contributors and issue submitter. ðŸš€ You are great!**

### What is declined or rejected:

- Change of the speed of the transition from on to off and off->on. This is not supported via the UDP API and can only be configured via WiZ App.
- The Motion Sensor is not integrated
- Color saturation is not supported by HASS

## ðŸ“” DNS / IP Address Tip

If you are using DHCP IP address features and looking for avoiding static IPs for the bulb, you can use the DNS names.
To avoid the mess with the IPs you can use the Hostnames of the bulbs.
The hostname will be created from the last 6 digest of the MAC and the `wiz_` prefix. Example: `wiz_123123` or `wiz_123ABC` .
So you can have dynamic IPs, but this hostname will not change. The MAC address you can find in your router or via `nc`.
One of the next versions of this integration will show the MAC in the "Device Properties" tab. Overall, your DNS resolution should work ðŸ˜‰.

If you run into DNS issues, please add a "." at the end of the bulb dns name. Example `wiz_123452.`.

## ðŸ”„ Test Connction

To test the connection between the bulb and your Wi-Fi router, you can use the RSSI value.
You can test the [RSSI ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indication) with this command: `echo '{"method":"getPilot","env":"pro","params":{}}' | nc -u -w 1 <AddressOfYourBulb> 38899`.
If the RSSI value is close to -100 the signal is not that good. Everything between -70 and 0 should be fine.

e.g. ESP01_SHDW1C_31
ESP01 -- defines the module family (WiFi only bulb in this case)
SH -- Single Head light (most bulbs are single heads) / LED Strip
TW -- Tunable White - can only control CCT and dimming; no color
DW -- Dimmable White (most filament bulbs)
RGB -- Fullstack bulb
1C -- Specific to the hardware - defines PWM frequency + way of controlling CCT temperature
31 -- Related to the hardware revision
```

## Install for testing

1. Logon to your HA or HASS with SSH
2. Go to the HA 'custom_components' directory within the HA installation path (The directory is in the folder where the 'configuration.yaml' file is located. If this is not available - create this directory).

4. Run `cd custom_components`
5. Run `git clone https://github.com/sbidy/wiz_light` within the `custom_components` directory
6. Run `mv wiz_light/custom_components/wiz_light/* wiz_light/` to move the files in the correct diretory
7. Restart your HA/HASS service in the UI with `<your-URL>/config/server_control`
8. Add the bulbs either by:
HA UI by navigating to "Integrations" -> "Add Integration" -> "WiZ Light" (If it is not available, clear your web browser cache to renew the integrations list.)
